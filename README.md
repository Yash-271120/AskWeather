AskWeather is a simple and minimalistic weather app build with Javascript


## Inspiration

In the beginning, the main purpose of this application is just to practise my newly learned Javascript and API knowledge and have a real-world app building experience.

But later on, I realised that there is no such minimal looking and informative weather app available where you find all weather information in one place.

And then I decided to make a perfect weather app from my perspective which will be a minimal and complete  information loaded weather app, no matter how much time it takes to complete as I was a complete beginner.

## Differencing Features


- Minimal and modern user interface 
- A to Z information that a weather app can have 
- Data in the form of charts and graphs for better understanding
- Radar functionality


## API

Weather data is retrieved from http://openweathermap.org/
